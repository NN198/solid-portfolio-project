This repository contains a collection of games developed using the Unity Game Engine, created during a game jam hosted by Duck-sauce Games, which lasted two days.
**Contribution Highlight** <br/>
I contributed to a game inspired by the classic Whack-A-Mole arcade game, integrating a unique feature that utilized a 3D hand-tracker using OpenCV. In this game, players interact with the environment by using the hand-tracker to physically touch cymbals, triggering navigation to the next game in the series.
